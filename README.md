# APO
Author's implementation of ["Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning with Trust Region Methods"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03442).

### Installation
This code is based [my forked version](https://github.com/xtma/rlpyt) of [rlpyt](https://github.com/astooke/rlpyt). To reproduce the results in paper, please run `python run_exp.py`. Note that this python file contains all the hyperparameters I have tried on 8 GPUs. Please set your hyperparameters manually before your experiments.
